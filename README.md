## Introduction
This Java program demonstrates a 2-stage security encryption process for messages using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data.

This program provides a simple command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using AES encryption. It employs a 2-stage approach, where the message is first encrypted with a user-generated AES key, and then the AES key itself is encrypted with a password provided by the user.

## Features
- Two-stage encryption for enhanced security.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- AES encryption for message and key.
- Password-based key derivation for key encryption.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line.

## Security Considerations
- Use a strong, unique password for key encryption.
- Keep your password secure, as it's essential for decrypting messages.

## License

## Acknowledgments
- This program uses the AES encryption algorithm provided by the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).
